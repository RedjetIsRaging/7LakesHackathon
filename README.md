# Instructions
This project is for the 2021-2022 SLHS Hackathon. The topic is the "Power of One". The controls of this project is WASD and SPACE. WASD is to move. Touch enemies to eliminate them and speed up. I would advise running this on visual studio or some form of IDE.

# The Story
This one guy, Joe, was born, but he got rejected out of his society because he was a good guy and the entire society is a villainous organization. However, he came back and went into one of their meeting dungeons and the elimination begins. His secret power is to teleport whoever he touches wherever he wants, so he sends them to prison. The objective is to speedrun this. That way, Joe can get back home. Also, did I mention that he also gets faster whenever he teleports people?
